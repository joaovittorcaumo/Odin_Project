<!--
    To make space between boxes that are inside a flex container, in css, you can]
    use this command: justify-content: space-between
    justify-content aligns items across the main axis.
    You can also use justify-content to connect the box, with justify-content: center

<!--
    One more useful feature of flex is gap. It adds a specified space between flex items.
    It's very similar to add a margin to the items themselves.
    Use example: gap: 8px
