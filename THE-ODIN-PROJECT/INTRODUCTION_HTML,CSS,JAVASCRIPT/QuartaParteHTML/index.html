    <h2> LINK BETWEEN WEBSITES</h2>
    <p>
        To create a link in html, you must use an "ancor element", wich is
        defined by wrapping the text in a. For example:
        <a> CLICK ME </a>. This wont work because the ancor must be linked 
        to a destination
    </p>
    <p>
        For this to work, you must use an href(hyperlink reference). it should
        look like this: 
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about"> CLICK ME </a>
    </p>
    <h2> ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE LINKS</h2>
    <p>
        Absolute links are used to link your page to other page's through out the
        internet. Example: <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>
    </p>
        Relative links are used to link with other pages in the same website.
        Example: <a href="about.html">About</a>. This works because the files 
        are in the same directory, but for more advanced projects, we want to 
        have the index page at the root directory and the other ones in the 
        child directory
    </p>
    <p>
        To link the index to another file in a different directory, you must include
        the path of the file. Example: <a href="test/about.html">About</a>
    </p>
    <h2> IMAGES</h2>
    <p>
        To display an image in html, we use < img > element. Unlike other elements, img 
        doesn't use the closing parameter. Instead of wrapping the content, it embeds an
        image into the page using a src attributo wich tells the browser where the image is
        located. For example: <img 
        src="https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f5/51c300658911e6815cedc942c833a6/partc_logo_square.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=1">
        Besides the src attribute, every image should also have an alt(alternative text) 
        attribute for example:
        <img
        src="https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f5/51c300658911e6815cedc942c833a6/partc_logo_square.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=1"
        alt="The image">
