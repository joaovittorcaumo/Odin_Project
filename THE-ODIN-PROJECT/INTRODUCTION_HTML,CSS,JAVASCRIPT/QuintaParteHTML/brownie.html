        This is my absolute favorite brownie recipe. They are rich, fudgy in the middle, and made completely from scratch. These brownies are so much better than the box, and I bet you have what you need to make them already sitting in your kitchen.
    </p>
    <h3>Recipe: </h3>
    <p>
        These brownies require one bowl and come together in minutes. There’s also a good chance you already have the ingredients on hand. Let me walk you through the steps for making them.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Butter</strong> adds so much more flavor than oil ever could. We use 100% butter in the recipe and don’t feel the need to add oil.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Sugar</strong> balances the bitterness of unsweetened cocoa powder and adds to the texture of the brownies. It makes the centers soft and the tops crinkly.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Cocoa</strong> powder adds our chocolate element and makes these taste rich.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Eggs</strong> add richness and provide structure to the brownies.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Salt and Vanilla</strong> help to round out the flavor of the brownies. Salt in baking might seem odd, but just like in savory cooking, it awakens the flavors of the recipe
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Flour</strong> is the last ingredient you need, but you don’t need much. Remember, we’re on the hunt for extra fudgy brownies, and keeping the flour to a minimum helps with that.
    </p>
    <h3>Steps to make the best brownies: </h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 1: </strong>Melt the butter with sugar, salt, and cocoa powder. Here is where the saucepan comes into play. Make something called a double boiler, a fancy term for a small saucepan filled with an inch or two of water set over low heat. I place a bowl with the butter, sugar, and cocoa powder over the saucepan and watch as they melt into a gritty-looking mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 2: </strong>Add the vanilla and eggs. We use two eggs to make the brownies, but I add them one at a time. I add the first egg and mix it into the butter, sugar, and cocoa powder. When the first egg is mixed in, I repeat with the second egg,
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 3: </strong>Add the flour. After mixing the flour into the batter, I beat the batter with a spoon for 40 to 50 strokes. The batter will be thick. This extra beating makes sure that the butter emulsifies into the batter, which makes sure the brownies bake perfectly in the oven.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 4: </strong> Bake them. The brownies bake in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes.   
    </p>
    <h3>And we are done :D</h3>
