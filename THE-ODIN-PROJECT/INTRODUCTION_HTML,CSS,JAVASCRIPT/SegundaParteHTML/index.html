                Testing different paragraph`s. In it's "original" way, the
                program just print everything toghether, without bothering about
                the space lines we applied, to solve this issue, we use the p element
        </p>        
        <p>
            This way, the program will recognize different paragraph's
        </p>
        <p>
            The program also has a different in order inbetween the heading
            (h1,h2.....h6), the number 1 being the largest and most visible,
            and the sixth being the smaller and less visible
        </p>
        <h1>
            The biggest
        </h1>
        <h6>
            The smallest
        </h6>
        <p>
            There's also a way to make text look bolder, more visible
            and a perfect way to emphasize its importance: <strong> for example
                this text is way more visible than the rest
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            There's also another way to emphasize text, wich is to make it
            italic, to do that we must use em: <em> this text is from italy</em>
        </p>

            To make comments in HTML, you must use <!-- THIS IS A COMMENT -->
            as i made it a comment, its impossible to read from the website, so you 
            must look at the code.
