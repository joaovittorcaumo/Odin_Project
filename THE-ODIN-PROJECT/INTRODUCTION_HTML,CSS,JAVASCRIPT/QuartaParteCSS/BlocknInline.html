<!--BLOCK VS INLINE
    Most of the elements that you have learned about so far are block elements.
    In other words, their display style is: display: block.

    Inline elements do not start on a new line. They appear in line with whatever
    elements they are placed beside. A example of an inline element is <a> or <strong>.
    They can be used inside a paragraph for example.
    -->
<!--DIVS AND SPANS
    Normally, a HTML element has a meaning to be used, for example <img> stores an image,
    <p> a paragraph, but divs and spans can be used for any purpose.
    Div is a block-level element by default. It is used normally as a container element,
    styled by css, to group other elements. For example: 
    -->
    
    
    <div class="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="main-content">
       <h2>Main Content</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="contact-us">
       <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    </div>
<!--
    Spans on the other hand are inline elements by default. It's normally used to group
    text content and inline HTML elements for styling. It should only be used when no other
    semantic HTML element is appropriate. Example:

-->
<p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do
    eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad
    minim veniam, <span class="highlight">quis nostrud <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/exercitation">exercitation</a>
    ullamco laboris</span> nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.   
  </p>
